# Retail Store Data Analysis Report

## Introduction

This project undertakes a comprehensive data analysis of a sample super store to understand its operational intricacies. By examining key metrics and trends, the study aims to derive actionable insights for business optimization. Using a blend of statistical tools and data visualization techniques, we will evaluate the store's sales, profitability, and customer behavior patterns. The findings from this analysis can offer valuable perspectives for stakeholders, aiding in informed decision-making and strategy formulation for the store's future.

## Data Set Information

- **Row ID**: A unique identifier for each row.
- **Order ID**: The sales order number.
- **Order/Ship Date**: The dates the order was placed and shipped.

## Data Preparation

We have three tables: Orders, Returns, and People, all connected using common keys like Order ID and Customer ID. The data preparation phase involved:

- Cleaning up the data by ensuring all columns were properly labeled and formatted.
- Replacing blank values with 'Not Available'.
- Sorting and filtering the data to focus on relevant parts.
- Adding new columns for calculations, like shipping duration.
- Applying conditional formatting to highlight important trends and outliers, making the data ready for clear and effective analysis.

During this phase, anomalies such as 'Order Date' being later than 'Ship Date' were identified and flagged for correction to ensure data accuracy.

Using conditional formatting, filters, custom filters, and sorts, we obtained the following insights:

- Orders with negative profits were highlighted in red.
